      <p>The Schr√∂dinger Equation in its most general form is given by</p>
      <p> <Equation formula="$i \hbar \dfrac{\textrm{d}}{\textrm{d}t} | \psi(t) \rangle = \hat{H} | \psi(t) \rangle \, .$" /> </p>
      <p><Equation formula="$\psi(t)$"/> is the wave function (state vector), <Equation formula="$\hat{H}$"/> is the Hamiltonian operator and <Equation formula="$t$"/> is time. </p>
      <p>It can't be solved generally as the Hamiltonian operator, which, similar to the Lagrangian, cannot be derived, but needs to be inserted appropriately to the given physical situation.
